Hello, this is my random soduku generator website built with flask.
I used a backtracking algorithm to create the algorithm to solve the sudoku by removing all values from all the domains of the slots in the row, column, or box of a value just added and then checking to see if any of the domains of the slot is greater than the amount of values in the column, row or box minus the total number of assigned slots in the sudoku already. 
I also made this project into a website to polish up on some of my javascript and web development skills.
